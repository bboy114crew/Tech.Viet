  "description": "Through our network of learning centers and partner schools, we provide tech-enabled personalized learning for students in Vietnam.  \n\nFounded by Harvard and Stanford graduates, Everest Education (E2) strives to inspire every student that walks through our doors. We prepare students mentally and academically for rigors of an international education in E2's small classes, camps, and VIP tutoring. We instill an intellectual curiosity that becomes the foundation for lifelong learning. By cultivating critical thinking, communication, creativity, and teamwork skills, we empower students to succeed in tomorrow's global environment.\n\nE2 personalizes learning. We don?t force students into a \"one-size fits all\"? program that?s too difficult for some and too easy for others. Instead we?ve developed our own blended learning approach that customizes instruction to deliver the right material, at the right level of difficulty, at the right time for every student. \n\nE2 currently offers supplementary courses in math, English, test preparation, computer programming, private tutoring, and STEAM camps (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math). \n\nWe are always seeking world-class talent to join us in our mission of transforming and personalizing learning in Vietnam.  If you are innovative, collaborative, and passionate about education, come join us.\n\nSee current available roles and apply here:\nhttps://careers.e2.com.vn",
